join1x

【name】

join1x : Join master file to transaction file (only matching lines are joined),
	 but the master file can have records that share the same key value.

[Format]

Usage : join1x [+ng[<fd>]] key=<n> <master> [<tran>]
Version : Fri Jul 22 01:09:14 JST 2022

【Explanation】

Only those rows in the text file <tran> where the <key> fields of
<tran> match corresponding fields of <master> are selected,
then joined with the fields in <master> and output.  The join occurs
by adding the fields from <master> immediately after the key field
in <tran>.  However, the difference between this command and join1
is that there may be more than one record in <master> that share the
same key value.  (join1 requires the key fields in <master> to be
unique.)

The files are joined for every combination of <master> and <tran>
records where the key fields have the same value.  
Both files must be sorted in ascending order ("master" on the first field and 
"tran" on the key fields.)

If there are multiple key fields, the <master> key field will be the key field 
in the same order as the <tran> key field, with the smallest field slid to 1.
For example, when key=3/5, sequence = 3 consecutive fields key, 
so <master> is 1 to 3 consecutive fields, that is, the 1st to 3rd fields are keys.

If - is specified for master, the standard input is used as the master file. 
If tran is not specified or - is specified, the standard input is the transaction file.

With the +ng option, output matching lines to the standard output file and non-matching lines 
to the file with file descriptor <fd>. 
If <fd> is omitted, output to the standard error output file.

The difference from join1 is that records with the same key field value in the master file
The point is that multiple nodes can exist. Keys for master and transaction files
Records with the same field value are concatenated by total multiplication and output.

[Example 1]

(master: master)
$ cat master

1 Ueno
2 Umeda
2 Namba
2 Kyobashi
3 gold mine
3 Sakae
3 Atsuta
4 Hakata
4 Tenjin
