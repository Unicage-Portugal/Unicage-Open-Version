Version : Sun Aug 28 11:47:10 JST 2022
Edition: 1

【Explanation】

Sort <file> according to key=<key>. As <key> you can specify the position of the field.

   msort key=2 file
   msort key=2/5 file
   msort key=3@1@NF file

There is no limit on key length or number of key fields. 
It does not matter if it contains multi-byte characters such as Japanese. 

You can use r after a field position sorts that field in descending order. 
If you specify n after the field position, that field's values will be sorted as numbers. 
If you specify N after the field, the values will be sorted in descending order as numbers. 
You can also use nr to compare numerically and sort in descending order. 


If the fields before and after the / have sort types, they must be aligned before and after.

   msort key=2n/5n file o
   msort key=2n/5nr file ×
   msort key=2n/5r file ×

If no file name is specified or - is specified, it reads from standard input.
