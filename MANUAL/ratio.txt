【name】

ratio : Composition ratio calculation

[Format]

Usage : ratio key=<key> [<file>]
Option : ref=<ref> 	←Specify reference key
         : -<s> 	←decimal precision
         : +<n>h 	←Consider the first <n> lines as a header
Version : Mon Nov 15 02:12:05 JST 2022

【explanation】

Within a group of records (rows) in <file> (or stdin) that have the
same value in the <key> field , calculates the ratio that each row
makes up out of the total of all rows in the group, and inserts the
ratio as a new field immediately following the key field.
Specify - as <file> or omit it to use the standard input.

【Example 1】

$ cat data	← File structure 1:Store_name 2:Date 3:Number_of_sales 4:Number_of_customers
Store_A Day1 103 62 	
Store_B Day1 210 113
Store_C Day1 81 52
Store_D Day1 75 48
Store_E Day1 211 140

Execute the following command to find the composition ratio of the sales volume (3rd field) 
by store and insert it into the next field after the sales volume.

$ ratio key=3 data | keta
Store_A Day1 103 15.1 62 	←The composition ratio is in the 4th field
Store_B Day1 210 30.9 113
Store_C Day1 81 11.9 52
Store_D Day1 75 11.0 48
Store_E Day1 211 31.0 140


[Example 2] ref option

The field specified by ref= is used as a key field, and the composition ratio is calculated 
and output in the lines with the same key field value. 
Note that the key fields must be sorted in advance.

$ cat data	← File structure 1:Store_name 2:Date 3:Number_of_sales 4:Number_of_customers
Store_A Day1 103 62
Store_A Day2 157 94
Store_A Day3 62 30
Store_B Day1 210 113
Store_B Day2 237 121
Store_B Day3 150 82
Store_C Day1 81 52
Store_C Day2 76 49
Store_C Day3 38 21
Store_D Day1 75 48
Store_D Day2 72 42
Store_D Day3 34 19
Store_E Day1 211 140
Store_E Day2 149 91
Store_E Day3 120 73

Calculate the composition ratio of the number of sales (third field) by store 
for each day (second field).

$ sort -k2,2 -k1,1 data | ratio ref=2 key=3 | keta
Store_A Day1 103 15.1 62 	←Composition ratio of 4th field on 1st day
Store_B Day1 210 30.9 113
Store_C Day1 81 11.9 52
Store_D Day1 75 11.0 48
Store_E Day1 211 31.0 140
Store_A Day2 157 22.7 94 	←Composition ratio of 4th field on 2nd day
Store_B Day2 237 34.3 121
Store_C Day2 76 11.0 49
Store_D Day2 72 10.4 42
Store_E Day2 149 21.6 91
Store_A Day3 62 15.3 30 	← Composition ratio of 4th field on 3rd day
Store_B Day3 150 37.1 82
Store_C Day3 38 9.4 21
Store_D Day3 34 8.4 19
Store_E Day3 120 29.7 73


[Example 3] +h option

If you add the +<n>h option, the composition ratio is calculated by skipping the first <n> lines. 
It is used when calculating data that already has headers such as item names in the first row. 
The header of the newly added composition ratio field is @.

$ cat data
Store Date Number_of_sales Number_of_customers 	← Item name header
Store_A Day1 103 62
Store_B Day1 210 113
Store_C Day1 81 52
Store_D Day1 75 48
Store_E Day1 211 140


Skips the first line and calculate the composition ratio of the number of sales (3rd field) 
by store and insert it into the field next to the number of sales.

$ratio +h key=3 data | keta
Store Date Number_of_sales @ Number_of_customers   ←"@" is inserted at added field
Store_A Day1 103 15.1 62 	←The composition ratio is in the 4th field
Store_B Day1 210 30.9 113
Store_C Day1 81 11.9 52
Store_D Day1 75 11.0 48
Store_E Day1 211 31.0 140


[Example 4] -<s> option

You can specify the precision below the decimal point of the composition ratio with <value>.

$ cat data
Store_A Day1 103 62
Store_B Day1 210 113
Store_C Day1 81 52
Store_D Day1 75 48
Store_E Day1 211 140


Calculate the composition ratio of the number of sales (3rd field) by store to 3 decimal places.

$ ratio -3 key=3 data | keta
Store_A Day1 103 15.147 62
Store_B Day1 210 30.882 113
Store_C Day1 81 11.912 52
Store_D Day1 75 11.029 48
